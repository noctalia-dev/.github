## Overview

**Noctalia** is a Wayland shell setup built on Quickshell.
It started as a simple personal config, but has grown into a collection of themes, tools, and components - all aiming for a clean look, smooth feel, and easy customization.

This is the **central hub** for all Noctalia projects.  
If you’re looking for the actual quickshell setup, check out [**noctalia-shell**](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell).
